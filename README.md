## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Build Configuration
The app uses Gradle version catalogs for dependency management. Key configurations:

```kotlin
// app/build.gradle.kts
android {
    compileSdk = 35
    defaultConfig {
        minSdk = 27
        targetSdk = 35
    }
}
```

### Database Configuration
```kotlin
// Room database setup
@Database(
    entities = [TaskEntity::class, CategoryEntity::class, FocusSessionEntity::class],
    version = 2,
    exportSchema = true
)
@TypeConverters(Converters::class)
abstract class InternalDatabase : RoomDatabase()
```

## üé® UI Components

### Custom Components
- **WheelTimePicker**: Custom time selection wheel
- **TaskItem**: Swipeable task card with actions
